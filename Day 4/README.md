# Day 4 Projects

## Plant Monitoring System Using Soil Moisture DHT11 & MCU (NodeMCU or Arduino)
---
1. A pump has to trigger whenever soil moisture dropes below 40
2. Whenever Temeprature goes above 36 digree
3. Send data to thingspeak also make a custom dashboard
---
## Obstacle Avoidance Bot
---
1. Integrate the Ultrasonic logic and motor driver logic to make a bot that avoids obstacles on left and right side
2. Make the code and make sure the logic is correct and it is working fine
3. Wire up the bot and controll speed and make agood obstacle avoider robot
## Web controlled Robot
---
1. Integrate the web logic and motor driver logic to make a bot that is controlled by your phone
2. Setup node MCU as a Accespoint and connect your bots to that NodeMCU
3. Follow similiar steps as Obstacle avoider
---
## Hosting A website Through GitHub
---
## Self Project
---
### Make bot in which we can controll the speed while Running and Can can change direction while running which also displays how far away is the obstacle to web dashboard locally
