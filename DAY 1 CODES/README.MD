# Instruction for Day 1 Code

1. The code is for a simple LED Blink program
2. You can use the same code by copy pasting the content in the main.cpp file in src folder to Arduino IDE
3. Make sure you Remove the `#include <Arduino.h>` line from the code
4. Or you can simply clone the repository and work on with it platformio
5. If you are using Arduino IDE, make sure to select the correct board and port
6. The code will blink the LED connected to pin D4 of the Arduino board
7. You can change the pin number in the code to blink a different LED
8. The code will blink the LED with a delay of 1000 milliseconds
9. You can change the delay time in the code to blink the LED with a different delay
10. Make sure to upload the code to the board after making changes

# 11. You can use the Serial Monitor to see the output of the code

# 12. The code will print "ON" and "OFF" in the Serial Monitor

# 13. You can change the message in the code to print a different message
